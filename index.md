### Looking for other girls who code and geek out like you?

The **WiCS Chapter at UMass** mainly serves undergraduate female/femme/non-binary CS majors at UMass and seeks to adovocate for and unite the community! 

Here's a list of activities we plan to hold during Spring 2018:
- Grad school panel
- HackerRank & Facemasks night
- WiCS logo contest
- SheSpeaks (inspired by SheHacks Boston)

Our events are open to all genders! If you'd like to be more involved in hosting events, fill out [this form](https://wicsumass.typeform.com/to/Ioy4jq) and one of our co-chairs will reach out to you! In the meantime, check back often for updates on events, conferences, and meetups.
