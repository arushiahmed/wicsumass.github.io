#### About Us

Women in Computer Science at UMass Amherst (WiCS @ UMass Amherst) is a student organization run by undergraduate members of the College of Information and Computer Sciences. It was established as a complement to the graduate women in computing group and aims to foster a stronger bond between all female and non-binary members of the CS community. Through bonding activities, workshops and various other activities, we create a safe space for minorities in computing to develop and grow together.
